# golang-gin-architect

Pragmatic software architecture for Go Gin APIs. The "brain" that orchestrates all other gin skills.

## What's Included

- **references/complexity-assessment.md** — Full decision trees, complexity budget framework, right-size thinking, pattern selection matrix, "you don't need this yet" gates
- **references/system-design.md** — C4 model, bounded contexts, domain modeling, dependency graphs, Go package layout at scale
- **references/data-patterns.md** — CQRS, event sourcing, saga, transactional outbox, read replicas — high-complexity patterns with prerequisite gates and Go examples
